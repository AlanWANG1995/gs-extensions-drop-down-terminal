TODO:

v1
- initial, basic version

v2
- copy/paste via popupmenu + shortcuts (ctrl-shift)
- dnd
- detect active pid and ask before exiting the shell? (or detach it?)
- preferences (term + height + early fork)
- restore the animation, but it suffers the same issue as the other related extensions:
  we need to move the window (out of the screen before) before it is mapped

- investigate the focus issue and restore the default BLOCK cursor
- investigate if the inner-border can be retrieved

v3
- test on multihead: global.screen.connect('monitors-changed', ...)
- pause the child process if term closed and no active pid (for powersaving, maybe an additional pref?)

v4
- multi tabs?

v5
- enable translations (seriously, it's a terminal)
- investigate argb colors not working
